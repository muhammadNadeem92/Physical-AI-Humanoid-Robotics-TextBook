# Research Summary: Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Decision: Content Structure and Format
**Rationale**: Following the Docusaurus documentation standard with Markdown format as specified in the project constitution. Each chapter will follow the template structure: Introduction, Core Concepts, Examples/Real-world Scenarios, and Summary & Key Takeaways.

## Decision: Physical AI Definition and Distinction from Traditional AI
**Rationale**: Physical AI refers to AI systems that interact with the real world through sensors and actuators, as opposed to traditional software-only AI systems. This distinction is fundamental to the module's learning objectives.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Using the term "Embodied AI" exclusively - decided against as "Physical AI" is broader and encompasses more applications
- Focusing only on robotics - decided to include other physical AI applications like self-driving cars and drones

## Decision: Examples for Physical AI Applications
**Rationale**: Selected self-driving cars, warehouse robots, and drones as primary examples because they clearly demonstrate the perception-action-feedback loop that defines Physical AI systems. These examples are familiar to learners and showcase different aspects of physical interaction.

## Decision: Approach to Explaining Embodied Intelligence
**Rationale**: Will use the sense-think-act loop model to explain how intelligence emerges from body-brain-environment interaction. This model is widely accepted in robotics and provides a clear framework for understanding embodied intelligence.

## Decision: Humanoid Robot Subsystems Coverage
**Rationale**: Will focus on the five major subsystems: mechanical structure, sensors, actuators, control systems, and AI software. This aligns with the functional requirements and provides a comprehensive overview for beginners.

**Famous Robots to Include**: ASIMO, Atlas, and Pepper were selected as they represent different aspects of humanoid robotics development and are well-known in the field.

## Decision: Learning Assessment Approach
**Rationale**: Will incorporate knowledge checks and practical examples throughout each chapter to ensure learners can meet the specified success criteria. This includes comprehension questions and simple thought experiments.
