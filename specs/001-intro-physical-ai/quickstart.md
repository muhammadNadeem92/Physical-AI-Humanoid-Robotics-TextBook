```

### 2. Creating Chapter 1: What is Physical AI?

#### Content to Cover:
- Definition of Physical AI
- Difference between software-only AI and Physical/Embodied AI
- Role of perception, action, and feedback loops
- Examples: self-driving cars, warehouse robots, drones

#### Writing Guidelines:
- Use beginner-friendly language
- Include diagrams or simple analogies
- Avoid heavy mathematical derivations
- Focus on practical understanding

### 3. Creating Chapter 2: Embodied Intelligence
