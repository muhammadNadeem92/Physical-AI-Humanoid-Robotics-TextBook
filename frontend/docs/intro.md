# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive educational resource on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This textbook is designed for beginners to early-intermediate learners with basic programming knowledge who want to understand the fascinating world of physical artificial intelligence and humanoid robotics.

## About This Textbook

This textbook takes a structured approach to learning about Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics:

1. **Physical AI**: Understanding AI systems that interact with the real world through sensors and actuators
2. **Embodied Intelligence**: Exploring how intelligence emerges from the interaction between body, brain, and environment
3. **Humanoid Robotics**: Learning about robots designed with human-like characteristics and capabilities

Each module builds on the previous one, creating a solid foundation for understanding these complex topics.

## Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This first module provides the essential foundation for understanding Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics:

- [What is Physical AI?](./module-01-introduction/01-what-is-physical-ai.md) - Learn the fundamental differences between Physical AI and traditional AI systems
- [Embodied Intelligence](./module-01-introduction/02-embodied-intelligence.md) - Understand how intelligence emerges from body-brain-environment interaction
- [Introduction to Humanoid Robotics](./module-01-introduction/03-introduction-to-humanoid-robotics.md) - Explore the major subsystems and famous examples of humanoid robots

## Learning Approach

This textbook is designed with the following principles in mind:

- **Beginner-friendly**: Concepts are explained before terminology
- **Practical examples**: Real-world applications illustrate theoretical concepts
- **Self-contained chapters**: Each chapter can be understood independently
- **Progressive complexity**: Building from fundamental concepts to advanced applications
