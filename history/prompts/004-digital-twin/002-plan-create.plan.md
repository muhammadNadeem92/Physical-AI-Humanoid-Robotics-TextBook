# Planning Creation for Module 4: The Digital Twin: Gazebo & Unity Simulation

## PROMPT_TEXT

$ARGUMENTS

## RESPONSE_TEXT

I have successfully completed the planning phase for Module 4: The Digital Twin: Gazebo & Unity Simulation. Here's a summary of what has been accomplished:

## Planning Phase Completion Summary

### 📋 **Plan Files Created**
- **plan.md**: Implementation plan with technical context and constitution check
- **research.md**: Comprehensive research on simulation technologies and approaches
- **data-model.md**: Content structure model defining the educational entities
- **quickstart.md**: Quickstart guide for learners
- **contracts/**: Content structure contract in OpenAPI format

### ✅ **Phase 0: Outline & Research**
- Resolved all technical unknowns and dependencies
- Researched Gazebo, Unity, and ROS 2 integration patterns
- Made architecture decisions with rationale
- Validated success metrics and learning outcomes

### ✅ **Phase 1: Design & Contracts**
- Created content structure model with entities and relationships
- Defined validation rules and learning progression
- Created quickstart guide with estimated timeframes
- Established content contracts for structure and requirements
- Updated constitution check with post-design evaluation

### 🎯 **Key Deliverables**
1. **Technical Context**: Clearly defined educational content approach with concept-first methodology
2. **Content Structure**: 4 chapters following Introduction → Concepts → Examples → Summary template
3. **Technology Stack**: Gazebo for physics simulation, Unity for visualization, ROS 2 integration
4. **Learning Path**: Sequential progression building on Module 3 concepts
5. **Quality Standards**: Accuracy, reproducibility, and beginner-friendly approach

The planning phase is now complete and the feature is ready to move to the task generation phase (`/sp.tasks`) and implementation phase (`/sp.implement`). All required planning artifacts have been created and the constitutional requirements have been verified.

## OUTCOME

The planning phase for Module 4: The Digital Twin: Gazebo & Unity Simulation has been successfully completed with all required artifacts. The implementation plan, research findings, data model, quickstart guide, and content contracts have been created. The feature is ready to proceed to the next phase of development.
