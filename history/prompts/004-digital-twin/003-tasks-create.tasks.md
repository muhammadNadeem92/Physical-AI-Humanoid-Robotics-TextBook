# Task Generation for Module 4: The Digital Twin: Gazebo & Unity Simulation

## PROMPT_TEXT

$ARGUMENTS

## RESPONSE_TEXT

I have successfully generated the tasks.md file for Module 4: The Digital Twin: Gazebo & Unity Simulation. Here's a summary of what has been accomplished:

## Task Generation Summary

### 📋 **Tasks Created**
- **Total Tasks**: 86 executable tasks (T001 to T086)
- **Phase 1**: 3 setup tasks
- **Phase 2**: 3 foundational tasks
- **Phase 3**: 16 tasks for User Story 1 (Digital Twin Concepts)
- **Phase 4**: 15 tasks for User Story 2 (Gazebo Simulation)
- **Phase 5**: 16 tasks for User Story 3 (Unity Visualization)
- **Phase 6**: 16 tasks for User Story 4 (Sim-to-Real Validation)
- **Phase 7**: 16 tasks for Polish & Validation

### ✅ **Key Features of the Task Structure**
1. **User Story Organization**: Tasks organized by the 4 user stories from the specification with priorities (P1-P4)
2. **Checklist Format**: All tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels, and file paths
3. **Parallel Markers**: Tasks marked with [P] where they can be executed in parallel
4. **Story Labels**: User story tasks marked with [US1], [US2], [US3], [US4] as required
5. **Clear Verification Criteria**: Each task includes specific verification criteria
6. **Dependencies**: Clear file path dependencies for each task
7. **Independent Testability**: Each user story has clear independent test criteria

### 🎯 **Implementation Strategy**
- **MVP**: User Story 1 (Digital Twin Concepts) as standalone testable module
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each user story builds on previous but remains independently testable
- **Parallel Execution**: Identified opportunities for parallel execution across different files
- **Quality Focus**: Tasks include verification of concept-first approach, diagrams, and beginner-friendly content

The tasks.md file is now ready for execution via the implementation phase (`/sp.implement`). Each task is specific enough for an LLM to complete without additional context, and all tasks follow the required checklist format.

## OUTCOME

The task generation for Module 4: The Digital Twin: Gazebo & Unity Simulation has been successfully completed with 86 executable tasks organized across 7 phases. The tasks follow the required checklist format and are organized by user stories with proper labels and verification criteria. The feature is ready to proceed to the implementation phase.
